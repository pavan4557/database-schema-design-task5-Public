#Task 5 – SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)
Objective

The objective of this task is to practice using SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables. After this task, you will be able to:

Retrieve data from multiple tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL joins.

Understand cross join, natural join, and self-join.

Analyze relationships between tables.

##Tools Used

DB Browser for SQLite

MySQL Workbench

Key SQL Concepts

##INNER JOIN
Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.

##LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table; NULL if no match.

##RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table; NULL if no match.

##FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.

##CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of the tables (all possible combinations).

##NATURAL JOIN
Automatically joins tables on columns with the same name.

##SELF JOIN
A table joined to itself, useful for hierarchical or comparison queries.

Examples & Outputs

INNER JOIN: Lists only customers who have orders.

LEFT JOIN: Lists all customers, even if they have no orders.

RIGHT JOIN: Lists all orders, even if some customer info is missing.

FULL OUTER JOIN: Combines LEFT and RIGHT join results.

CROSS JOIN: Produces all possible pairs of customers and orders.

SELF JOIN: Finds pairs of customers in the same city.

##Interview Q&A

Difference between INNER and LEFT JOIN?
INNER JOIN returns only matching rows; LEFT JOIN returns all left table rows even without a match.

-What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?
Returns all rows from both tables; missing matches are NULL.

-Can joins be nested?
Yes, you can join multiple tables in a single query.

-How to join more than 2 tables?
By chaining multiple JOIN clauses.

-What is a CROSS JOIN?
Produces all combinations of rows from both tables.

-What is a NATURAL JOIN?
Automatically joins on columns with the same name.

-Can you join tables without foreign key?
Yes, using columns with matching values.

-What is a SELF JOIN?
Joining a table to itself to compare rows.

-What causes Cartesian product?
CROSS JOIN or missing join conditions.

-How to optimize joins?
Use indexes, minimize columns in SELECT, avoid unnecessary joins.

✅ Outcome
After completing this task, you will be able to:

Combine and analyze data from multiple tables.

Use all types of joins effectively.

Understand relationships between tables in SQL queries.
